# LiveFaceTracking
livefacetracking.py uses OpenCV to detect and track faces in real-time from a webcam feed. It draws bounding boxes around detected faces and updates continuously as the user moves. The script demonstrates real-time face detection with OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for various computer vision applications.
